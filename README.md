# AddressBook
Personal Java project which allows to consult in/add into/remove contacts from a graphical application. The datas are stocked into a ".properties" file.
This made me get familiar with Java.awt.* and Java.swing.* librairies.
The whole Javadoc is also available at html format in the source code.
You can download it right here :

Please make sure to put the "phone.properties" file in the same directory than "AddressBook.exe" before launching the app !
